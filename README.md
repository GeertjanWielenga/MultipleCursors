# MultipleCursors

   Block/rectangular selection is already possible, including being able to change words in the block, at the same time.

   ![Alt text](/pics/block-select-1.png?raw=true "Step 1")
   
   Would be even better if random words can be selected, as shown below:
   
   ![Alt text](/pics/block-select-2.png?raw=true "Step 2")
   
   The above is already possible via the code here. The next step is to enable all selected items to be changed together.
